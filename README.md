# Peter Fortier's Personal Portfolio

**Thanks for checking out my work!** Aside from the preinstalled files that come with `react-static create`, I handtyped all the code for this website myself! I also designed all the SVGs, visuals, and my personal logo (this excludes the FontAwesome icons featured in the *Contacts* portion of the page).

## Made with React-Static

This app was created using the `blank` template of `react-static create` provided by [React-Static](https://github.com/react-static/react-static).
